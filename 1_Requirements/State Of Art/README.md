  PROBLEM OF EXISTING SYSTEM
                   
         1. Inability of modification of data: The managing of huge data
            effectively and efficiently for efficient results, storing the details of the
            consumers etc. 
         2. Not user friendly: The existing system is not user friendly because
            the retrieval and storing of data is slow and data is not maintained
            efficiently.
         3. Difficulty in reports generating: Either no reports generating in a
            current system or they are generated with great difficulty reports take
            time to generate in the current system.
         4. Manual operator control: Manual operator control is there and lead
            to a lot of chaos and errors.
         5. Lot of paperwork: Existing system requires lot of paper work and
            even a small transaction require many papers fill. 
         6. Inability of sharing the data: Data cannot be shared in the existing
            system. 
         7. No support in decision-making: Existing system does not support
            managerial decision-making.
         8. No support in strategic competitive advantage: Existing system do
            not support strategic competitive advantages.

 CHARACTERSTIC OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
             
         1. Easiness in modification of data: The proposed system provides
            managing of huge data effectively and efficiently for efficient results,
            storing the details of the customers, employees etc. 
         2. User friendly: The proposed system is user friendly because the
            retrieval and storing of data is fast and data is maintained efficiently.
            Moreover the graphical user interface is provided in the proposed
            system.
         3. Reports are easily generated: Reports can be easily generated in a
            proposed system. So any type of reports can be generated in a proposed
            system, which helps the managers in a decisions-making activity.
         4. Sharing the data is possible: Data can be shared in proposed system.
         5. No or very few paperwork: The proposed system either does not
            require paper work or very few paper works is required.
         6. Support strategic competitive advantage: Proposed system supports
            strategic competitive advantages. Since the proposed systems provide
            easiness in reports generating it will provide strategic advantages among
            competitors.
         7. Computer operator control: Computer operator control will be there
            no errors. Moreover storing and retrieving of information is easy. So
            work can be done speedily and in time.
